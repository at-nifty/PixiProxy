# PixiProxy: Bridging the Past and Present Web
PixiProxy is a specialized proxy server designed to let legacy web browsers, like those found on the Dreamcast (e.g., Internet Explorer 3-5), access modern websites.

Many contemporary websites use HTTPS for secure connections and are built with HTML5 and JavaScript, making them inaccessible or unviewable on older systems. PixiProxy acts as an intermediary, converting HTTPS requests to HTTP and optimizing modern web content (HTML, CSS, images) into a format these older browsers can understand and display.

This means you can revisit the modern web on your retro hardware, transforming complex, heavy pages into lightweight, compatible versions, and overcoming issues like garbled text or extremely long loading times.PixiProxy-
